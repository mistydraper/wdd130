    <p>
      Hello, my name is Misty Draper. I live in Phoenix, Arizona, and currently,
      work for a school district in a support staff position. I am pursuing a
      degree in Applied Technology and would like to be a data analyst.

      I married my husband in 1997, and we have three children. Our oldest
      daughter is getting married in December. Our son is in high school, and
      our youngest is in middle school. In all my spare time, I do laundry.
    </p>

      I am grateful for the opportunity that BYUI and the Pathways program have
      given me to finish my degree. It has been a great experience, and I look
      forward to the rest of the journey.
